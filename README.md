# Onion Location for Shopware 5

Do you want to provide your customers with an additional layer of privacy? A hidden service may help you with that!

This plugin implements the [onion-location meta tag](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/onion-location/#using-an-html-<meta>-attribute) into your frontend.

Customers are now notified that there is a hidden service available if they connect via the tor network.
